# MovieGrossPredictor
*Machine Learning Algorithms to predict overall movie gross using 23 out of the possible 28 features from IMDB dataset from Kaggle*

## Project Description and Dataset
* The Project details, background research, analysis, and implementation of the algorithms can be found here: [Project Paper](https://github.com/msk610/MovieGrossPredictor/blob/master/estimating-movie-gross.pdf)

* The Dataset used can be found here: [Original Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/deepmatrix/imdb-5000-movie-dataset) 

* The Dataset was preprocessed and normalized and the final training and testing sets can be found in the repo. The preprocessing of the data can be found in the project paper

## Project Test Run
* Following image is a test run of the algorithms. The [main.cpp](https://github.com/msk610/MovieGrossPredictor/blob/master/main.cpp) includes a simple menu that allows users to run any one of the three algorithms and at the end of the run shows the average error of the different models utilized along with an approximate runtime.
